# Prunejuice Documentation

> It helps the PM go smoother

Welcome to the documentation for **Prunejuice** - a parallel agentic coding workflow orchestrator that helps manage development workflows across git worktrees with integrated tmux session management.

## What is Prunejuice?

Prunejuice is a unified Python implementation that provides:

- **Native Python Implementation**: Fully integrated worktree and session management without shell script dependencies
- **Git Worktree Integration**: Create, manage, and remove git worktrees seamlessly
- **Tmux Session Management**: Automatic session creation and lifecycle management for development environments
- **Command-Based Workflow**: Define and execute complex development workflows through YAML configurations
- **Modern Python Stack**: Built with asyncio, Pydantic, Typer, and GitPython

## Installation

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv add prunejuice

# Or with pip
pip install prunejuice
```

## Quick Example

```bash
# Initialize prunejuice in your current directory
prj init

# Check project status
prj status

# List available commands
prj list-commands

# Run a command
prj run setup-dev
```

## Philosophy

Prunejuice follows these principles:

- Make each step of the SDLC scriptable and able to run independently
- Generate and store supporting artifacts with each step (plans, specs, analysis, reviews)
- Treat prompts and instructions as first-class items represented as template files
- Provide comprehensive Git worktree and Tmux session management
